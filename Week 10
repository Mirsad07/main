Using the two arrays shown below, write a program that prompts the user to enter an
integer between 1 and 12 and then displays the months and its number of days
corresponding to the integer entered. Your program should display “wrong number” if
the user enters a wrong number by catching ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
InputMismatchException
The previous program works well as long as the user enters an integer. Otherwise, you
may get another kind of exception. For instance, if you use nextInt() of Scanner, you could
have an InputMismatchException. Modify it to prevent users entering anything other
than an integer.

package week10;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.InputMismatchException;
public class DisplayMonth {
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
		String [] months= {"January","February",
				"March","April","May","June","July",
				"August","September","October","November","December"};
				
		int[]days= {31, 28, 31, 30,31,30,31,30,31};
     Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
		try {
		System.out.println("Enter the month");
		int month=input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("The number of days for " +
		months [month-1]+" is "+
		days[month-1]);
		}
		catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
		{
			System.out.println("The month should be a number between 1 and 12");
			
	     }
		catch(InputMismatchException e)
		{
			System.out.println("Month should be a number");
		}
	}
}


IllegalTriangleException
Define the Triangle class with three sides. In a triangle, the sum of any two sides is greater
than the other side. The Triangle class must adhere to this rule. Create the
IllegalTriangleException class, and modify the constructor of the Triangle class to throw an
IllegalTriangleException object if a triangle is created with sides that violate the rule:
package week10;

public class IllegalTriangleException extends Exception {
public IllegalTriangleException(int a, int b, int c) {
	System.out.println("Incorrect");
    }
}

package week10;

public class Triangle {
private int a, b, c;
public Triangle(int a, int b, int c)throws IllegalTriangleException
{
	if(a+b<c|| b+c<a||a+c<b)
throw new IllegalTriangleException(a, b, c);
	else
this.a=a;
this.b=b;
this.c=c;
}
public int getSideA() {return a;}
public int getSideB() {return b;}
public int getSideC() {return c;}

}

package week10;

public class TestTriangle {
	
public static void main(String [] args)
{
	try {
		Triangle triangle1=new Triangle(2, 2, 10);
System.out.println("Triangle correct");
	}
	catch(IllegalTriangleException ex)
	{ 
		System.out.println(ex.toString());
	}
	
	}
  }
